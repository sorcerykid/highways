Highways Mod v1.0
By Leslie Krause

Highways automatically constructs a network of walkable paths throughout the world during 
the map generation phase, thereby encouraging users to explore.

The concept and source code are derived from paramat's excellent "Pathv6alt" mod which has 
been adapted for mapgen v7 and heavily tweaked for use with the Just Test Tribute game.

The path itself is intended to serve as a public right of way. Therefore, the nodes are 
unbreakable to prevent griefing. Simply use WorldEdit, if needed, to make adjustments in 
proximity to player builds.
